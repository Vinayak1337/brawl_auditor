fulljslint.js contains the fully commented JSLINT function.

fulljslint.html runs the JSLINT function in a web page. The page also depends
on adsafe.js [www.ADsafe.org] and json2.js [www.JSON.org] (which are not
included in this project) and intercept.js and fullinit_ui.js (which are). The
js files should all be minified, and all except fullinit_ui.js are concatenated
together to form fullwebjslint.js.

intercept.js augments ADsafe, giving widgets access to cookies and the JSLINT
function.

fullinit_ui.js hooks the HTML ui components to ADsafe.

lint.html describes JSLint's usage.

JSLint can be run anywhere that JavaScript (or Java) can run. See for example
